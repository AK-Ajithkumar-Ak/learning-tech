        <p>Comments in Python begin with a hash mark ( # ) and whitespace character 
            and continue to the end of the line. Because comments do not execute,
             when you run a program you will not see any indication of the comment there.
              Comments are in the source code for humans to read, not for computers to execute.
               A triple quoted multi-line string is also treated as comments</p>
